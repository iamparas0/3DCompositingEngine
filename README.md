# Open-Source 3D Compositing Engine

## Overview

This project is an open-source **3D Compositing Engine** designed for video creators and VFX artists. The engine allows for seamless integration of 3D models into 2D video footage, with support for complex lighting, textures, and physics-based rendering. Users can upload models, adjust lighting, and synchronize 3D objects with video footage through a React-based UI.

---

## Features

- **3D Rendering Engine**: Supports complex lighting, textures, and physics simulations.
- **Camera Tracking**: Synchronizes 3D models with video camera movement.
- **Physics Simulation**: Supports physics-based rendering using a custom physics engine or Bullet Physics.
- **React UI**: Web-based interface for users to interact with the engine, upload assets, and manage scenes.
- **Asset Management**: Load and manage 3D models, textures, and scenes.
- **Shader Support**: Includes support for custom shaders (GLSL, HLSL).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-compositing-engine.git
   cd 3d-compositing-engine
   ```

2. Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
   - **C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC or MSVC)
   - **OpenGL** or **Vulkan** for rendering
   - **Bullet Physics** (optional, for physics simulations)
   - **Python** (for scripting integration)
   - **Node.js** and **npm** (for React-based UI)
   - **CMake** (for building the project)

3. To build the engine, run the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. To start the React-based UI, navigate to the `/src/ui` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src/ui
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the engine is built and the UI is running:

- **Upload Models**: Use the UI to upload 3D models and textures.
- **Adjust Settings**: Modify lighting, camera position, and physics parameters in real time.
- **Render**: Export the final composited scene with 3D objects integrated into video footage.
